            <h3>School</h3>
            <p>I finished high school in Carleton Place which is where I grew up. Then just this past year I took the Design Foundations program here at the school, I took it because I wasn't sure about what I wanted to go into and I'm still not a 100% on that but the program did help a little! With my birthday being Decemeber 24<sup>th</sup> I was also a lot younger then everyone going into school last year so I wasn't in a rush. Now I am in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program! </p>
